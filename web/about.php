			<p>
			<!-- Main content starts here -->
			<br>
			MechMod is a total conversion of the Half-Life engine and is based on <b>Mecha</b> or <b>Mechs</b> (note: You require <a href="http://www.steampowered.com">Steam</a> and a legitimate copy of Half-Life to be able to play MechMod Alpha). We have already released a primary Alpha 1.0 version of the mod, which was based on mechs taken from the Gundam and Macross/Robotech series. Alpha 1.0 was a 'test' release which the team put together while waiting for Half-Life 2 to go public, and the Alpha was also considered as a <i>stepping stone</i> towards something much bigger.<br>
			<br>
			MechMod has been featured on multiple reputable websites, and was also given a full page in the January 2005 edition of the PC GAMER UK magazine:<br>

			<br>
			MechMod stresses the importance of strategy, player reflexes, and teamplay all put together. Whether you want to play fast-paced or slow - MechMod has all the options available for you. The player has the ability to pick from different classes of mechs and customize them to his/her needs and desires. Our originally planned Beta version (for Half-Life 2 instead of 1) included designs for mecha customization, which would not only affect the aesthetics of your mech, but also the feel and usage of it. <br>
			<!--You may support your team by building structures and turrets as a builder mech, you may find enemy locations or set traps as a scout mech, you may be an asset to the team as an assault mech, or you may go all out on the offensive with a heavy mech. MechMod has been developed to allow the player to take control and take the game in the direction that he/she wants to. The mod also offers different types of game play modes, to help cater to those who might not necessarily want to play strategically, and simply want to crush some metal!-->
			<br><br>
			To find out more about how to play MechMod, the different mechs available, how to use bots, etc. refer to the manual found in the bonus folder of your MechMod folder (once installed).</p>
